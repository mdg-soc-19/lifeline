This app is related to IITR-Hospital.

The app will impact the whole IITR community as it will shorten the time spent in queues at the hospital token counter and pharmacy. All doctors can now attend the patientsâ€™ hassle-free and students can save a huge amount of time. 

### Goals

I want to save time of IITR people through this android app and also avoid sack of inconvenience (like Doctor is not available, or related to token no.).

It will provide an online platform where users can connect with the happenings of the hospital via an android app.
